Welcome on my portfolio !\n

You'll find here my works on different topics: machine learning and high performance computing.
Actually my master degree was oriented toward high level mathematics: PDE, machine learning, computer
vision and signal processing. \n

Feel free to browse this projects, each contains a short description of what it is about,
and all the tools used so that you can ... \n

Finally if my profile interested you, I'm looking for a job as machine learning engineer,
computer vision engineer or any job related with that. \n
